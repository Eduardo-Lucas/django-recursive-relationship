# django-recursive-relationship

This is the code for a blog post I published on [Stackabuse](http://stackabuse.com/recursive-model-relationships-in-django/) where I describe how to use the Python Django web framework to model recursive data using an implementation technique known as the adjacent list technique.  This implementation is contrasted in a later post that uses the modified preordered tree traversal technique also on Stackabuse [here](http://stackabuse.com/modified-preorder-tree-traversal-in-django/).
